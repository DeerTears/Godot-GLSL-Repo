# Godot-GLSL-Repo

A repo for my personal Godot GLSL creations.

I made this repo for two reasons:  
1. Boost the appearance of my proficiency GLSL to others  
2. Share the shaders I have made with others more readily, for websites like [godotshaders.com](godotshaders.com)  

## Spatial Shaders

### Screenspace Texturing

todo. here's the repo of where this shader currently sits: https://github.com/DeerTears/Spatial-Screen-Space-Texturing

## CanvasItem Shaders

### FlatSky

Two colours that create a sky horizon. Intended as the contents of a ViewportTexture for a PanoramaSky resource.

### CircleSky

A coloured halo sitting on the horizon of the sky. Great for emulating the glow of the sun in the sky.

I used this in my itch game [Winter Weather](https://deertears.itch.io/winter-weather).
